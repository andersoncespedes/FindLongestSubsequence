# FindLongestSubsequence

QUESTION DESCRIPTION
Consider every susequence of an array of integers.
• Sort the subsequence in increasing order.
• Determine the sum of differences of elements in the subsequence.
• Return the length of the longest subsequence where this sum is even.

We can see that the máximum posible length of a valid subsequence is 4.

Function Description
Complete the function findLongestSubsequence in the editor below.
FindLongestSubsequence has the following parameter(s):
Int arr[n]: an array of integers
Returns
Int: the length of the longest subsquence as describe
Constraints
• 3 ≤ n ≤ 105
• 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
Input Format For Custom Testing
The first line contains an integer, n, the number of elements in arr.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines ((where 0 ≤ i < n) contaisn an integer, arr[i]
